# Leetcode Obsidian Frontend

_A Customizable Obsidian Publish alternative using Next.JS forked from [matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter](https://github.com/matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter)_

## Getting Started

This is the frontend code that publishes the Obsidian vault notes from [davzoku/leetcode-obsidian-vault](https://github.com/davzoku/leetcode-obsidian-vault).

Run the following command to run the front end.

```
npm run dev
```

The steps to publish a similar website is shown in this original [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKSpK1dXn4E).

## Deviations

Matthew published the website on Vercel, while I published it on Netlify. This is a personal choice and it can be done easily by changing the final GitHub Action step, "Deploy to Vercel" or "Deploy to Netlify" in [publish.yml](https://github.com/davzoku/leetcode-obsidian-vault/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml).
